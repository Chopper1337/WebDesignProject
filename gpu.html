			<h2 class="subTitle">What is a GPU?</h2>
			<p>A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device. GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.
			Although GPU's are usually used by consumers for gaming because of their extremely fast graphics processing power, they can also be used for compute based tasks such as AI, media upscaling, or "mining" crypto-currency.
			This is because both regular graphics rendering, such as in games, and AI, upscaling and crypto-currency mining all use similar types of equations which a CPU would struggle with while a GPU can fly through them.</p>

			<p>Things to note when buying a GPU:<br></p>
				<ol>
					<li>GPU's can comfortably operate and up to 80 degrees celcius</li>
					<li>You can't compare clock speeds between cards of different brands (AMD or nVidia)</li>
					<li>Some GPUs will be faster than others in different workloads even at the same price-point</li>
					<li>If a GPU is to be used for gaming, don't get caught up too much in comparisons between different models of the same GPU</li>
