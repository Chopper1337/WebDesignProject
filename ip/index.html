<h1>CIDR Notation</h1>
<p>CIDR Notation is the number of bits in the subnet mask. You can get the CIDR notation of a classfull address with the following steps:

<ol>
<li>Find how many 255's there are in the subnet mask
<li>Consider each 255 as 8 bits (8 bits in binary = 255 in decimal)
<li>Add the number of bits
</ol>

	CIDR Notation exists as there are cases where you may wish to use a different number of Networks and Hosts on your network than is possible with just changing class.<br>
	Increasing the number of bits assigned to Networks (The 1's), allows you to have more networks.<br>
	Increasing the number of bit assigned to Hosts (The 0's), allows you to have more hosts.

<h1>Subnetting</h1>
<p>
<b>What is the valid range of hosts of the following IP address:</b>
 <b style="text-decoration: underline;">192.168.2.32/28</b>
<br>
<h3>First determine the class of the IP:</h3>
Class A: 1-126
<br>
Class B: 128-191
<br>
Class C: 192-223
<br>
Class D: 224-239
<br>
Class E: 240-254
<br>
<br>
These ranges are in relation to the first octet of the IP, which in this case is "192", making this a Class C address.
<br>
<h3>Now determine the class-full subnet of the IP:</h3>
Class A: 255.0.0.0
<br>
Class B: 255.255.0.0
<br>
Class C: 255.255.255.0
<br>
Class D: [RESERVED FOR MULTICASTING]
<br>
Class E: [EXPERIMENTAL; USED FOR RESEARCH]
<br><br>
As we have a Class C address, the class-full subnet is 255.255.255.0
<br>
but CIDR notation (/28) shows that this IP is classless as the CIDR notation for a Class C address is 24
<br>
In this case, we have more than 24 bits assigned for networks, 4 more bits have been added.<br>
Therefore, 255.255.255.0 is <a style="text-decoration: underline">not<a> the subnet mask of this address.
<br>
<h3>Now get the classless subnet:</h3>
192.168.2.32/<a style="text-decoration: underline">28<a><br>
The CIDR notation, <a style="text-decoration: underline">28<a>, shows there are 28 1's in the subnet mask's binary.
<br><br>
Here is the subnet mask's binary: <pre>11111111111111111111111111110000</pre>
Same binary but divided into octets: <pre>11111111.11111111.1111111111.11110000</pre>
To get the last number in the subnet mask, consider each "1" in the subnet mask binary to be the following:
<br>
<pre>128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1</pre>
In the missing part of the subnet mask, we have the binary 11110000:
<br>
<pre>
1     1	   1	 1	  0	  0	  0	  0<br>
128   64   32	 16	  8	  4	  2	  1
</pre>
Now add the numbers which have a "1" above them,
<br>
<pre>128+64+32+16=240</pre>
This results in the last number for the classless subnet mask, making our subnet mask as follows:
<br>
<pre>255.255.255.240</pre>
<h3>Finally, find the subnets</h3>
Taking 240 from 256 gives us the number of subnets:
<br>
<pre>256-240=16</pre>
Dividing this number of subnets by 256 gives us the range of hosts for each subnet:
<br>
<pre>256/16=16</pre>
Count by the range of the subnets til you reach 256. In this case, as the range of each subnet is 16, we count up in 16's
<br>
<pre>16 - 32 - 48 - 64 - 80 - 96 - 112 - 128 - 144 - 160 - 176 - 192 - 208 - 224 - 240 - 256</pre>
These divisions are the ranges of hosts for all 16 subnets.
<br>
Going back to the IP, 192.168.2.32, it exists here:
<br>
<pre>
16 - 32 - 48 - 64...^-----^
</pre>
32 and 48 are subnet identifiers which cannot be assigned as IP's, that means 192.168.2.33 is the first IP in this range.
<br>
192.168.2.47 is therefore the broadcast address for this subnet.
<br>
<br>Therefore this is the valid range of IP's for this subnet:
<br>
<b>
192.168.2.33 to 192.168.2.46</b></p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
Provided you fully understand this process, it is possible to do almost entirely in your head.<br>
Given an IP, for example, 10.156.54.22/10, you can see immediately that it is Class A and that the subnet mask begins with 255.<br>
From there, you can see that only two bits have been added, making the subnet mask 255.192.0.0.<br>
256-192=64, making the number of subnets 64.<br>
256/64=4, meaning there are 4 hosts per subnet.<br>
Counting in 4's lets us find the subnet in which this IP lies: 10.156.54.4, 10.156.54.8, 10.156.54.12, 10.156.54.16, 10.156.54.20, 10.156.54.24<br>
The IP is in the 10.156.54.20 subnet.<br>
10.156.54.20 is the identifier, making 10.156.54.21 the first host address.<br>
10.156.54.23 is the broadcast address, meaning there is only one truely usable IP per subnet on this network, considering that 10.156.54.21 could be used by the router.<br>
Not a networking setup I can recommend.
